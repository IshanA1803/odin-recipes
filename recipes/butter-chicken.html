    <h2>Know your dish ...</h2>
    <pre>
    This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite
    Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the
    chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting
    the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.
