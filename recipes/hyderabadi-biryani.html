Meanwhile, heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in cloves,

Stir in chile peppers and ginger paste. Stir in yogurt, salt, and curry, and then
place chicken in pan. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally and turning
the chicken pieces, until only about 1 cup of liquid remains.
